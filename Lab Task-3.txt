SELECT INITCAP(ENAME) AS NAME, LENGTH(ENAME) AS "LENGTH OF NAME" 
FROM EMP 
WHERE ENAME LIKE 'J%' OR ENAME LIKE 'A%' OR ENAME LIKE 'M%' 	
ORDER BY ENAME;


## 8. Create a query that will display the employee name and commission amount. If the employee does not earn commission, put “No Commission.” Label the column COMM.
