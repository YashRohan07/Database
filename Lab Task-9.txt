1. Create a view called EMPLOYEES_VU based on the employee numbers, employee names, and
   department numbers from the EMPLOYEES table. Change the heading for the employee name to
   EMPLOYEE.

    CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW EMP_VU AS
    SELECT EMPNO, ENAME "EMPLOYEE",DEPTNO
    FROM EMP;


2. Display the contents of the EMP_VU view

    SELECT *
    FROM EMP_VU ;


3. Using your view EMP_VU, enter a query to display all employee names and department numbers.

      SELECT EMPLOYEE, DEPTNO
      FROM EMP_VU;


4. Create a view named DEPT20 that contains the employee number, employee name, and department number for all employees in department 20. Label the view column EMPLOYEE_ID, EMPLOYEE, and DEPARTMENT_ID. Do not allow an employee to be reassigned to another department through the view.

    CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW DEPT20 AS
	SELECT EMPNO "EMPLOYEE_ID", ENAME "EMPLOYEE",DEPTNO "DEPARTMENT_ID"
	FROM EMP
	WHERE DEPTNO = 20
	WITH CHECK OPTION CONSTRAINT DEPT20;


5.  Create a view called SALARY_VU based on the employee name, department name, salary, and salary grade for all employees. Label the columns Employee, Department, Salary, and Grade, respectively.

        
        CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW SALARY_VU AS
	SELECT E.ENAME "EMPLOYEE", D.DNAME "DEPARTMENT", E.SAL "SALARY", S.GRADE "GRADE"
	FROM EMP E, DEPT D, SALGRADE S
	WHERE E.DEPTNO = D.DEPTNO AND E.SAL BETWEEN S.LOSAL AND S.HISAL;
